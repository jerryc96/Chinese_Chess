# Chinese Chess

A playable chinese chess game built using React.

Version 0.1 alpha: Board complete and responsive (will scale depending on screen size)

How to run:

1) Download the repo

2) run `npm install`

3) run `npm start` to start the game on Localhost.

Next Steps (chronological):

Adding pieces, with the ability to move and capture

Defining specific pieces and restrict it so you can only play legal moves (eg. horses should not move like rooks)

Adding a scoreboard to see what you and your opponent's moves were, based on Western chess notation.
